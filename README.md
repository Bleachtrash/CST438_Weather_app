## Overview
This is a weather app that makes use of the APIs api.geonames.org and api.weather.gov found [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file)
The styling guide used for this document can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Introduction
* Communication for this project was achieved through the use of Slack and during in-person discussions held during class time
- Around 10 issues were initially considered at the start of the project
- In total 17 issues were completed

**What was your role?**
Peter worked on implementing the core functionality of the app. Getting most of the pages working to the point where they could be passed onto other teammates to have the ui reworked or database interactions set up. As well as setting up and implementing api functionality.

* **What was the biggest challenge?**
	* Learning and working with a new language and design process.
* **Why was it a challenge?**
	* I am not used to learning so many new things on the fly in the middle of a project.
* **How was this challenge addressed?**
	* By doing research online and using my teammates as a resources for learning.
* **Favorite / most interesting part of this project**
	* My favorite part of the project was working on the main weather view. It incorporated a lot of new things I never encountered before like composable UI and working with APIs. It was fun to learn.
* **If you could do it over, what would you change?**
	* I would definitely want to do do more serious work earlier on in the project as to lessen the crunch at the end.
* **What is the most valuable thing you learned?**
	* Communicating with your teammates is by far the most important thing you can do.

## Conclusion
* **How successful was the project?**
	* I would say the project was very successful. Not only did we manage to incorporate all of our base ideas, but we also improved on them and improved our product past our original vision.
* **What was the largest victory?**
	* My largest victory was getting the app to the state where you could actually use it to see the weather in your location.
* **Final assessment of the project**
	* The project surpassed my initial vision for it, and in the end we came out with a product that I was genuinely proud of. While there are things that we never got to finish we ended up with fully fledged and working product.

**What was your role?**
Tanner worked on primarily the favorites page. As the project proceeded and my work was finished on the bare functionality and database of my page, I transitioned into more of a UX/UI role for our team; overhauling the looks of sign in, main activity, and favorites page.

* **What was the biggest challenge?**
    * Learning to work with an organized repository/
* **Why was it a challenge?**
    * I am not used to working with an team in which there are style guides and review required merge requests.
* **How was this challenge addressed?**
    * By following how to abide by the rules and it really feels like it was a good thing for me.
* **Favorite / most interesting part of this project**
    * My favorite part of the project was playing with the UX/UI design.
* **If you could do it over, what would you change?**
    * The initial architecture plan of the project for everybodies minds to be set on a level understanding of the project that we are working on.
* **What is the most valuable thing you learned?**
    * Organization is extremely important.

* **What was your role?**
* I worked on more backend, such as the database implementation(s) and connection with the API. I helped in (very minor) other spots when we were nearing the end of the project. 
* **Biggest Challenge?**
* Getting the API and database connected, or even getting the gradle to work. 
* **Why Was it Challenging?**
* The gradle is just a pain, and it tells you to do one thing even though it wants you to do something else as a solution. Then the API and database application was just a little confusing. 
* **Favorite Part of Project**
* My favorite part was getting to tinker with the API a little bit, although I stuck more to the database side of things. 
* **What would you change with a do-over?**
* I would submit things earlier and help my teammates wherever they needed it more. 
* **Valuable things learned?**
* Communication really does make a big difference, and getting things done by deadline is STRESSFUL, but important.
